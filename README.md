A tiny virtualized list implementation for Preact apps.

## Features

 * Tiny footprint (~2KB gzipped!)
 * No dependencies (BYO Preact/HTM)
 * MIT license
 * Browser-native ESM friendly (designed specifically to require zero build tools to run)

## Installing

```bash
npm install --save @twuni/ui-list
```

Yarn users, you know what to do instead.

## Usage

The following examples are written in JSX format, for brevity.

### Example: Basic Usage

```jsx
import List from '@twuni/ui-list';

<List
  count={1000000}
  renderItem={(index) => <p>Item {index}</p>}
/>
```

There are only two props:

 * `count` (number) - How many items are in the list, total.
 * `renderItem` (function(number)) - A function that, given the index of the item to render, returns the rendered list item.
